# Budget Tracker 

## Description of Project
Aa traveler I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so my account balance is accurate when I am traveling. 

## Aims/Goals
1. Given a budget tracker without an internet connection, when users enter expenses or deposits they will receive notification (confirmation?) that they have added an expense or deposit.
2. When the user reestablishes an internet connection the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.

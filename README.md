# Budget Tracker 

## Description of Project
As a traveler I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so my account balance is accurate when I am traveling. 
## Aims/Goals
1. Given a budget tracker without an internet connection, when users enter expenses or deposits they will receive notification (confirmation?) that they have added an expense or deposit.
2. When the user reestablishes an internet connection the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Heroku, Git

## Challenges Faced
The service worker was a bear. I had massive help from the instructional team. Thank you! 
I had trouble setting up my Atlas account correctly, Heroku deployment goes surprisingly well after fixing that! But to be fair, the Atlas code to connect the database to the Cluster DOES NOT include space for the `<dbname>`. You must provide that to make it work.
